<h3>Fuel is any substance used to produce heat and energy through a chemical or nuclear reaction. The energy is used by the conversion of a portion of the fuels mass. In India, we are suffering a severe fuel crises. In view of this, the Petroleum Conservation Research Association is encouraging fuel conservation. Our goal should be to reduce gasoline consumption progressively each year.

Fuel serves as a major part of our energy requirement. Petroleum, a major fuel is widely used in our everyday lives and also used to power automobiles, produce containers and to keep us warm. All plastic is made from it and used in cars, houses, computers, paraffin wax, paints and pharmaceuticals, at times it is also used as a solvent found in large quantities below the surface of the Earth and is used as fuel and raw material in the chemical industry.

areness for fuel conservation amongst your friends and relatives. There are three areas where the motorist can save fuel- proper maintenance, efficient driving habits

and intelligent purchase of a vehicle. One of the best ways to save fuel is to reduce speed, as speed increases, fuel economy decreases exponentially. Tyre pressure and car's dirty air filter should be checked, if not, it could harm its performance and economy. Petrol is also called black gold. </h3>
